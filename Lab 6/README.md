# Lab 6

Please note: Part 3 is optional. It is a great exercise if you want to deepen your understanding of FSMs and how to build control and datapaths. A bonus mark of up to 1% of the total course mark will be awarded for successful completion of Part 3 (the amount of bonus awarded will be scaled based on the number of test cases your code passes).  

Additional material: Prof. Paul Chow has prepared a couple of videos to help further your understanding of Lab 6 Part 2.  They can be viewed here:
