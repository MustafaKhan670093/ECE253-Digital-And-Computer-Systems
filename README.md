# ECE253-Digital-And-Computer-Systems

Using Verilog, Assembly, a FPGA and CAD tools, I designed logic circuits and microprocessors. This course built our understanding of modern digital and computer systems from the ground up (transistors to modern microprocessors). The lab work consisted of designing logic circuits and microprocessor systems. Programming was done in Verilog and Assembly. Intel's Quartus was used and a DE1-SoC FPGA board was programmed. On the other hand, for the ARM Assembly section of this course we used the ARMv7 DE1-SoC board on the [CPUlator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc&d_audio=48000) simulator.

This course is now complete.

**Plagerism warning:** If you are a student taking this course in the future, don't destroy your learning by copying solutions. At the end of the day, your skills are all you will have.
