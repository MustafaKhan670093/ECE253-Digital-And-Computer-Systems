# ECE253-Digital-And-Computer-Systems

Using Verilog, Assembly, a FPGA and CAD tools, I designed logic circuits and microprocessors. This course built our understanding of modern digital and computer systems from the ground up (transistors to modern microprocessors). The lab work consisted of designing logic circuits and microprocessor systems. Programming was done in Verilog and Assembly. Intel's Quartus was used and a DE1-SoC FPGA board was programmed.
